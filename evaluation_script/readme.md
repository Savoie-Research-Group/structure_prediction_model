Environment: pytorch=1.13.0, python=3.7, rdkit=2020.09.1.0

Note:
sys.path.append('/depot/bsavoie/data/Tianfan/structure_paper/train_script') -> the appended dir should be changed to the dir of train_script

1. Regular testing
2. Test model performance when contradictory results are inputted
   python test_contra.py -c config_contra.txt
